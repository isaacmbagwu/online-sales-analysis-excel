# JADONS’ HUB EXCEL MENTORSHIP PROJECT – SALES ANALYSIS

## 📊 Project Overview

As part of the Jadons’ Hub Excel Mentorship Program, I worked on a hands-on sales analysis project where I stepped into the role of a Data Analyst for an online retail company.

The goal was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that management can use to make informed business decisions. Using Microsoft Excel, I analyzed sales performance, built dashboards and uncovered trends across products, regions and time.

## 🔍 Key Insights

From the dashboard analysis several important business insights emerged:

* The company generated over **$56.4M in total sales**, yet recorded an overall **loss of $642,501**, indicating that operational or product costs are significantly impacting profitability.

* **Water Bottles, USB Cables and Backpacks** emerged as the top-performing products, showing that everyday utility and accessory items drive the highest revenue.

* The **United States** stands out as the strongest market, contributing the largest share of regional sales followed by Belgium and France.

* Monthly sales trends reveal relatively stable performance throughout the year with stronger sales recorded between **March and August** and a noticeable dip toward the final quarter.

* Across regions, **electronics and accessory products** consistently contributed the largest share of revenue while furniture and stationery products lagged behind.

These insights highlight both growth opportunities and areas requiring strategic cost and performance optimization.
